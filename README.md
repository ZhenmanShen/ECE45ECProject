# ECE45 Extra Credit Project WI24

## Description:

Audio synthesizer project created by ECE 45 students, written using the MATLAB language and MATLAB GUI.
Refer to the [project report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13E9s3n5GvA3LUMPCj05mgpjSJxrqFBBiJYZLalAYC9k/edit?pli=1) for more information and usage guidelines.

## Installation:
Download zip from our Github repository.
Open project into MATLAB and open the app1.mlapp file.
Click run on top to run the application.

## How to use Code:
### Select a Signal or Sound file.
- Sin Wave
- Sad Valentine by No Vacations
- White Noise
- Mary Had a Little Lamb
- Ode to Joy
### Apply filters and adjust audio.
- Sin Wave is only for graph demonstrations. Specified ui components will be enabled to allow you to change the sin wave. These ui components are the phase and frequency slider, amplitude envelope, and wave generators.
- White Noise is only a graph demonstration.
- For Sad Valentine by No Vacations. Use the ui components that will be enabled to modify the signal. Use the slider and knob components to modify the sound. Each modification will plot their respective changes to the graphs. You can play the modified signal through the “Play Modified Signal/Sound” button. 
- Mary Had a Little Lamb and Ode to Joy are graph/sound demos. They will plot their signal and play their respective sound but no modifications will be applied.
Play around and test all the synthesizer features!
